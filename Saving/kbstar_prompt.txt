In file, update PostData, ExtractData, and some business logic with this url: /quics?chgCompId=b028770&baseCompId=b028702&page=C025255&cc=b028702:b028770 capture the request params, form-data as PostData and use it to POST to server for Data Extraction.

Network Analysis:
 Then capture the reqeust url, request params and form data via this url: /quics?chgCompId=b028770&baseCompId=b028702&page=C025255&cc=b028702:b028770. Different website have different request, parameters or form-data. please identify and decide yourself.  

Instruction:
In __WEBSITE_NAME__.file after login, use /quics?chgCompId=b028770&baseCompId=b028702&page=C025255&cc=b028702:b028770 to POST to the server to get the HTML structure to extract some information (the website URL, 예금명, 계좌번호, 통화코드, 잔액, and 출금가능액) in 빠른조회 tab.
In postData format you need to follow:
this.postData += httpRequest.URLEncode("계좌번호", "UTF-8") + "=" + httpRequest.URLEncode(username, "UTF-8");
this.postData += "&" + httpRequest.URLEncode("계좌비밀번호", "UTF-8") + "=" + httpRequest.URLEncode(password, "UTF-8");
        

Data Extract Instruction:
When perform data extraction don't use regex pattern or static value, prefer to take the html structure and clean it from to capture the value like below: 

var titleSection = StrGrab(item, 'class="t-subject"', '</td>');
var title = StrGrab(titleSection, '">', '</a>').trim(); 
rather than 
// var titleSection = StrGrab(item, 'class="t-subject"', '</td>');
// var title = StrGrab(titleSection, '<a[^>]*>', '</a>').trim();

Format:
Implement your findings by adapting the structure from business_logic_template.txt into a properly formatted business_logic_template that can handle the specific request patterns of this educational platform.
